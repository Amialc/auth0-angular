# Auth0 + AngularJS + API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an AngularJS app that will use Auth0 and an API that you're going to be developing. That API can be in any language.

If you want to connect to a third party API like Firebase or Amazon, please check [this other seed](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular/tree/master/examples/widget-with-thirdparty-api).

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to have `npm`, `bower` and `grunt` installed.

If you don't have `bower` or `grunt` installed please run:

````js
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
````

Then, in the project main folder run the following commands:

````js
npm install
bower install
grunt watch
````

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running :).
